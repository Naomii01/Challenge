Once in responsivness the photos squeeze together to become smaller until it reaches a max-width of 400px where the header and subheader dissapears.\
Here is its deployment from netlify web link to see on **live** : https://naomi-photointeractive-challenge.netlify.app/

**Step 1**: Open Visual Studio Code
**Step 2**: Create a folder
**Step 3**: Create a HTML , CSS and JavaScript File: files called index.html , styles.css and script.js respectively and copy the codes for each. **Note** make sure the spelling for each file is written correctly.
**Step 4** : Select Click on index.html file to open live server to see the result livr visuals




On  **Coding Challenge 1: Array Manipulation**

**Step 1**: Your first need to install Node.js on your device 
**Step 2**: Create a folder
**Step 3**: Create a JavaScript File: Inside the folder, create a new file named arrayMap.js and copy the provided code into this file.
**Step 4**: Install prompt-sync Package: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run the following command to install the prompt-sync package: " npm i prompt-sync"
**Step 5**: Run the Script: After installing the prompt-sync package, you can run the script. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder containing arrayMap.js, and then run the following command: node arrayMap.js
**Step 6**: Input: After running the command, you'll be prompted to enter a list of numbers separated by commas. For example: 2,4,7,8,9,0,3. After entering the numbers, press Enter.
**Step 7**:Target Sum: Next, you'll be prompted to enter the target sum of your choice. Enter the target sum and press Enter.
**Step 8**:Result: The script will then calculate whether there exists a contiguous subarray within the input array that sums up to the target sum you provided. It will print either "True" or "False" depending on the result.

**NOTE** all of this is done in the Terminal in Visual Studio Code



On **Coding Challenge 2: String Transformation**

**Step 1**: Your first need to install Node.js 
**Step 2**: Create a folder
**Step 3**: Create a JavaScript File: Inside the folder, create a new file named stringTransform.js and copy the provided code into this file.
**Step 4**: Initialize Node.js Project: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder you created in step 2 using the cd command (e.g., cd path/to/stringTransform). Once you're inside the project folder, run the following command to initialize a Node.js project:npm init -y
This command initializes a new Node.js project with default settings. The -y flag automatically accepts all default settings without prompting you to enter them manually.
**Step 5**: Install readline-sync Package: The provided code uses the readline module for reading input from the user. This module is built into Node.js, so there's no need to install it separately. However, the code can be modified to use the readline-sync package, which provides synchronous user input/output functionality. To install this package, run the following command in your terminal:
npm install readline-sync
This command installs the readline-sync package and adds it as a dependency to your project.
**Step 6**: Run the Script: After installing the readline-sync package, you're ready to run the script. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder containing stringTransform.js. To run the script, execute the following command:node transformString.js
**Step 7**: Input: Enter your desired string (word) when prompted by the script and press Enter.
**Step 8**:View Result: The script will transform the entered string based on the specified conditions and print the transformed string to the terminal. The program will then exit.

**NOTE** all of this is done in the Terminal in Visual Studio Code
